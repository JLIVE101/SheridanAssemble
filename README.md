#We've Moved to BitBucket
####Not That there was anything much here to begin with but....
we moved to bitbucket, its a free version of github and its way more user friendly and easier to navigate. I HIGHLY suggest you use this. not that you have a choice anyway.

Once you create an account send me an email @ joshua.williams.programmer@gmail.com with your username for bitbucket so that i could add you as a private contributor. I promise you I wont move again. Also title the email "Bitbucket Sheridan Contributor - <your username here>" Or you could just message me on skype / whatsapp, whatever works for you.
