#Git / Github
Git -> This is an absolute must, just go on Lynda.com and watch the video "Git Essential Training with Kevin Skoglund"
Alternatives for learning git are youtube videos you find yourself. Heres one I like -> https://youtu.be/0fKg7e37bQE

#Foundation
Foundation -> for styling and for building a responsive website with ease. also a must know

#PHP - Laravel Framework
PHP Laravel Framekwork -> we're eventually going to transition into a web application but for now its just all
about the planning.
I haven't found any videos on that yet, I still have to learn it myself. Theres probably many Lynda.com tutorials
I chose this framework because it is the best one out of all the other php frameworks. I personally use codeigniter at
my work, however i did some research and almost everyone said Laravel is better so i think the transition should be
good.

#jQuery
jQuery is staple, and obviously essential. If you don't know jQuery learn it now here
-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxGhHNOkCU&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABdI2V8I_SWo22tFpgh2s6_

#LESS
Also consider learning LESS. I haven't learned it myself yet but it apparently makes css a lot easier and its simple
to use.
